# Homepage

This site constitutes my personal musings, as well as a "portfolio" of some of my projects. Since most of my projects
are proprietary by nature, you'll only really get to see the few things I've done publicly. Sorry about that folks.
I'm light on open-source contributions.

I'm hoping to do more with this site in the future. Like maybe a better theme.
