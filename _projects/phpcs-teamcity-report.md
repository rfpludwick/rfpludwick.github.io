title: PHP CodeSniffer TeamCity Report
layout: project
---

One thing which cropped up in my line of work back when I worked at [CD Baby](https://cdbaby.com/)) was that I wanted to apply PHP Code Sniffer standards against PHP code, and have those results reported in [JetBrains' TeamCity Server](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/). I wrote up the report formatter and we ended up open-sourcing it.

It's been forked at least once, and it's pretty rudimentary.
