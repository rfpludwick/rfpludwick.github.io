Well, I began my GitHub Pages site when I saw a few other people had them. I've
only really recently been doing anything in the open-source realm, so I figured
I should have a landing page for open-source work. Then I got to thinking even
more that I really needed a place online other than
[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/rfpludwick) to express some of my
professional and volunteer life. Thus, this GitHub repo and website were born.

I really don't have much to say at this point, other than welcome to my
relatively sparse site. I hope to add more and more over time, and I also hope
to blog/post on a semi-regular basis.
