# Site Started

_April 30th, 2018_

Well, I began my GitHub Pages site when I saw a few other people had them. I've only really recently been doing anything
in the open-source realm, so I figured I should have a landing page for open-source work. Then I got to thinking even
more that I really needed a place online other than [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/rfpludwick) to express some
of my professional and volunteer life. Thus, this GitHub repo and website were born.

I really don't have much to say at this point, other than welcome to my relatively sparse site. I hope to add more and
more over time, and I also hope to blog/post on a semi-regular basis.
