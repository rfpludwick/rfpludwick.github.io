Welcome to my relaunched GitHub Pages site! It's been awhile since my last post... late 2018, to be exact. Yeah, I sure am active around here, aren't I? Well, I do intend to change that a bit going forward. Today I've relaunched my site with the following changes & enhancements:

* New theme which I believe is more readable
* Broken out projects into their own pages with navigation
  * And removed some projects which didn't really deserve mention
* Added post backward/forward navigation
* Added sitewide navigation near the header
  * Also social media links in the navigation area
* Imported my [Manager README](/manager-README) into this site
  * Sorry [leadership](https://github.com/rfpludwick/leadership) repository!

I intend to post more frequently than three times over the course of three years, and to post things of substance - my thoughts about management, leadership, technology, and anything else which makes more sense to blog about rather than [tweet](https://twitter.com/rfpludwick) about.

So, enjoy my new look & content! All two readers of you.
