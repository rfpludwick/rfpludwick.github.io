# Manager README

_November 16th, 2018_

I'm a part of the [Rands Leadership Slack](http://randsinrepose.com/welcome-to-rands-leadership-slack/) (which I could talk about effusively in another post). As part of my participation in that community, I came across the idea of a manager README. The concept is pretty simple - apply the idea of a software library's README to a manager. How to deal with me as a manager.

I really liked the idea, so I developed my own a few months ago. I got pretty busy and never ended up posting it online. With a new hire joining my team here in the near future, I wanted to make sure I had it online for my new hire to read. Thus, everybody else gets to read it too! It's linked on the [Projects](/projects) page, but just for posterity here it is:
