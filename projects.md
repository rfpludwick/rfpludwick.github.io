## Home Assistant Configuration

I'm running [Home Assistat](https://home-assistant.io/) for home automations, as well as to collect together the various
Smart Home devices we have. I've been putting my configuration up on GitHub, if for nothing else so I have a backup in
case my Raspberry Pi 3 B+ which runs Home Assistant bites the dust.

## AWS Route 53 DDNS PHP Client

I switched my DNS hosting for my home domain to AWS Route 53, and I needed a solid DDNS client. So I ended up finding
one at [Flynsarmy](https://www.flynsarmy.com/2015/12/setting-up-dynamic-dns-to-your-home-with-route-53/) and modified
it for my own needs, as well as (tried) to make it a little more object-oriented. Not that it needed it. I'm using
Let's Encrypt ACME v2 for a wildcard SSL certificate as well.

## Bash Config

Like many other people, I have my own Bash configs. I based mine off of
[Victor Passapera's](https://github.com/vpassapera/BashConfigs) configs.

## PHP Code Sniffer - TeamCity Report

One thing which cropped up in my line of work (with [HostBaby](https://hostbaby.com/) and
[HearNow](https://hearnow.com/)) was that I wanted to apply PHP Code Sniffer standards against PHP code, and have those
results reported in [JetBrains' TeamCity Server](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/). I wrote up the report formatter
and we ended up open-sourcing it.
